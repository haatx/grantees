RCC Our Texas plans a photographic exhibition of the Ukrainian refugees displaced by the tragic war and its effects. Many parts of Ukraine are no longer safe to live in, so these people have to find a new place for themselves and their families. Our hope is that the images not only show the effects of the war but also how Houston is affected by this change."

As three female musicians we feel as though these pieces should be heard and enjoyed, and would love the opportunity to spread these masterpieces. Our proposed concert will include two months of rehearsals and a performance in early Aug. 2023, our concert space is still being decided but we would love to perform in a women's home, retirement community, or our local concert hall at the Moores School of Music."
