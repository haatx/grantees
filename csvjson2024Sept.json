My goal is to platform local BIPOC artists who otherwise wouldn�t have the opportunity to participate in formal art spaces due to transphobia, racism, poverty and other detrimental factors.

Thomas, returns to the Zilkha Theatre stage, June 14th, 2025, 7:30pm, ONE NIGHT ONLY, for the world premiere of \"H Place\", a play with music. \"H Place\" centers around the Harmony family,  pillars of the community. What should be their brightest moment is dimmed by family matters that threaten to ignite and send the entire Harmony legacy up in smoke.  Receiving highest scores across all Readers and awarded a Staged Reading at the Texas Educational Theatre Association 2022 PlayFest, \"H Place\" premiere comes at no better time than that of Houston's First Black Arts Festival."
